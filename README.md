sneaQy - a sneaky way to chat

## Inspiration

We think everyone wants to look productive, while you sneaQily are texting your friend! (we know we do.)

## What it does

sneaQy will record your keystrokes, and secretly send them as messages to a contact on WhatsApp. As you type, any text-based editor you are using will be populated with whatever you specify, using the OpenAI API. Incoming messages from your friend will be shown as inconspicuous tooltips next to your cursor.

## How we built it

We used the OpenAI API to generate the text that will populate your screen (you can actually still do what your boss asked!) We used Tkinter to build the frontend, selenium for the WhatsApp integration and Figma to plan the UI.

## Challenges we ran into

Integrating many different frameworks was quite difficult.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We did this as a two person team, and considering that one of us has never been to a hackathon before we are quite proud of ourselves for finishing with all of our initial specifications. We are also proud that we seamlessly integrated our software with a popular communication app without using the API.

## What we learned

We learned a lot about different frameworks for every level of development from backend to frontend.

## What's next for sneaQy

sneaQy has great privacy applications. You can look like you are typing a happy letter in public but you are actually writing an important work email.
